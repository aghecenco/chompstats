My proposal would be to rename kvm-ioctls to kvm since you have the ownership of the kvm name on crates.io.\r\n\r\nI agree that `ioctls` is not the happiest name for the module that has wrappers on top of the KVM API, but the name is not visible to people using kvm-ioctls because `Kvm`, `VcpuFd` and `VmFd` are exported with `pub use ioctls::{Kvm, VcpuFd, VmFd};`. Nevertheless, I added an [issue](https://github.com/rust-vmm/kvm-ioctls/issues/36) in kvm-ioctls to rename the `ioctls` module to something more meaningful. Do you have any suggestions on what the name should be?", "updated_at": "2019-05-04T15:54:43Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/comments/489339103", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/community/issues/55#issuecomment-489339103", "created_at": "2019-05-04T15:54:43Z", "id": 489339103, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ4OTMzOTEwMw=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4ODMwNA==", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 288304, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/288304?v=4", "login": "npmccallum", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/npmccallum", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/npmccallum/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/55", "body": "See: #80 ", "updated_at": "2019-10-22T08:07:38Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/comments/544850490", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/community/issues/55#issuecomment-544850490", "created_at": "2019-10-22T08:07:38Z", "id": 544850490, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU0NDg1MDQ5MA=="}]
