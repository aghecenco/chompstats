The firecracker model does not really abstract KVM-specific design decisions all that well and this makes some things quite challenging to understand. I am not sure a single crate is a good idea, as that would lead to devices being less generic and more difficult to extend. The model behind rust-vmm in my opinion is to allow very slim and purposeful VMMs, and not a one-size-fits-all solution.\r\n\r\nI can see a reason to separate devices into layers like: transport (PCI/MMIO), frontend (configuration of device and high-level handling of queues) and backend (handling of items in the queues for specific devices). This would allow sufficient separation to make it easy for someone to change the backend according to their needs, without having to dive too deeply into how the rest of the vmm is actually implemented.\r\n\r\nI would see the following crates:\r\n* virtio-device: this crate provides the generic traits required from a device to be counted as a virtio device\r\n* virtio-mmio / virtio-pci: transport-specific functionality for devices.\r\n* virtio-device-*: this is the default frontend + backend + backend traits for a specific virtio device.
