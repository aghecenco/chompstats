"https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-device/issues/11", "body": "> I have a few general concerns here:\r\n> \r\n> 1. vm-device has too many dependencies\r\nIt's a valid state. Currently we have dependency tree as:\r\nvm-device v0.1.0 (/ws/src/vmm/rust-vmm/vm-device.git)\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 kvm-bindings v0.2.0\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 kvm-ioctls v0.3.0 (https://github.com/rust-vmm/kvm-ioctls.git#681745a7)\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 kvm-bindings v0.2.0 (*)\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 libc v0.2.62\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 vmm-sys-util v0.2.0\r\n\u2502       \u2514\u2500\u2500 libc v0.2.62 (*)\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 libc v0.2.62 (*)\r\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 vm-memory v0.1.0 (https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-memory#8669369d)\r\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 cast v0.2.2\r\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 libc v0.2.62 (*)\r\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 vmm-sys-util v0.2.0 (*)\r\nAmong those, the vm-memory could be removed by using u64 instead of GuestMemoryAddress.\r\nkvm-bindings/kvm-ioctls are gated by features.\r\n\r\n> 2. it looks very x86_64 and linux specific. @petrutlucian94 can you offer some insight into interrupts on Windows? Is the trait generic enough to work for your usecase as well?\r\nAny plan to support HyperV in addition to KVM?\r\n\r\n> 3. At the design level it looks like the current trait doesn't follow the open-closed design principle. Specifically, if you need to add a new interrupt type, you need to change the following things:\r\n> \r\n> * define a new `InterruptSourceType` with the name of your interrupt\r\n> * define a new `InterruptSourceConfig`\r\nThe interrupt is a relative stable subsystem, it doesn't evolve as quick as the VirtIo subsystem.\r\nSo I choose to keep things straightforward.\r\n \r\n> I haven't have the time to dive deep into how interrupts work, but before merging this I would like to take some more time and discuss to see if we can get to a simpler Interrupt interface that can be useful for Firecracker as well. I find this of particular importance since we want the Virtio implementation to depend on the Interrupt trait.\r\n\r\n", "updated_at": "2019-11-13T05:32:26Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-device/issues/comments/553246543", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-device/pull/11#issuecomment-553246543", "created_at": "2019-11-13T05:32:26Z", "id": 553246543, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1MzI0NjU0Mw=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzE1MTY=", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 1931516, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1931516?v=4", "login": "jiangliu", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/jiangliu", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-device/issues/11", "body": "> One concern for me is, we can see that every device that uses MSI would have a `irq_routing: Arc<KvmIrqRouting>` which shows the whole routing information of system.\r\n> Is it available to keep such info in KvmIrqManager and when a device wants to add new routing entries,\r\n> call function to do that?\r\n\r\nIt's an implementation detail, both PciMsiIrq and KvmIrqRouting are hidden from device backend drivers.", "updated_at": "2019-11-25T05:55:58Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-device/issues/comments/558002530", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-device/pull/11#issuecomment-558002530", "created_at": "2019-11-25T05:55:58Z", "id": 558002530, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1ODAwMjUzMA=="}]
