Once the crate vmm-sys-utils is merged we will remove the definition from this crate so I don't see a point in investing in the documentation just yet.\r\n\r\nOn the other points, I will take care of them once I get all the public interface documented. Right now, I only added documentation for cap.rs, system.rs and vm.rs is in progress. I'll ping you when I manage to document all items in the ioctls module so you can re-review it. Sorry if I haven't been upfront about it and wasted your time on reviewing. I will change the name of the PR to RFC.
