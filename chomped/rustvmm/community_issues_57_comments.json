We hope to add vfio support for rust-vmm based on that work.\r\n\r\nthanks", "updated_at": "2019-05-20T02:28:51Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/comments/493819326", "author_association": "NONE", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/community/issues/57#issuecomment-493819326", "created_at": "2019-05-20T02:28:51Z", "id": 493819326, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5MzgxOTMyNg=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjEwNDM4NjM=", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 1043863, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1043863?v=4", "login": "sameo", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/sameo", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/sameo/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/57", "body": "@andreeaflorescu @raduweiss Given the reference to device passthrough in the [latest Firecracker update](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/firecracker-open-source-update-may-2019/), are you planning to use VFIO as well?", "updated_at": "2019-06-03T09:57:16Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/comments/498192633", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/community/issues/57#issuecomment-498192633", "created_at": "2019-06-03T09:57:16Z", "id": 498192633, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODE5MjYzMw=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5NDQ=", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 2815944, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2815944?v=4", "login": "andreeaflorescu", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/andreeaflorescu", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/57", "body": "@sameo We didn't scope the GPU support in Firecracker just yet and we don't know what the final solution will be there, so I don't think we can answer your question just yet.", "updated_at": "2019-06-03T12:32:40Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/comments/498237170", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/community/issues/57#issuecomment-498237170", "created_at": "2019-06-03T12:32:40Z", "id": 498237170, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDQ5ODIzNzE3MA=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjExMzczNjUy", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 11373652, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/11373652?v=4", "login": "chao-p", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/chao-p", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/chao-p/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/community/issues/57", "body": "Instead of having one crate to cover everything, I believe it's more useful to split this into several crates.
