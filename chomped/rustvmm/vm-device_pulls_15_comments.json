If I remember correctly there were two approaches:\r\n- each device or device type (i.e. legacy devices) in their own crate\r\n- all devices in the same crate with a way of compiling them out if you don't need them\r\n\r\nWe reached a compromise in the sense that we can start having commonly used devices in vm-device. If the list of devices increases too much, we can then move out some devices to separate crates. I should send an email about this and get input from everyone.", "updated_at": "2019-11-19T09:20:27Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-device/issues/comments/555409998", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vm-device/pull/15#issuecomment-555409998", "created_at": "2019-11-19T09:20:27Z", "id": 555409998, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NTQwOTk5OA=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5NDQ=", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 2815944, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2815944?v=4", "login": "andreeaflorescu", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/andreeaflorescu", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-device/issues/15", "body": "Closing this PR from now.
