For that functionality to work it needs to generate random strings.\r\n\r\nHowever, the random (for numbers) functionality already existed in firecracker (something to do with networking) and I have expanded it to simple (safe) strings, as I need that functionality and I __think__ it's probably useful in other places.\r\n\r\nI suppose the tempfile/tempdir functionality could be implemented using a counter instead, I'm not sure if that better or not, might cause major slowdown because of IO depending on where it's used. In any case I'm trying to introduce as little change as possible to the current way it's done currently.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose the answer to your question is it probably is for generic usage as I'm presenting it here. \r\n\r\nIf we don't feel the functionality is useful then I need to think again, perhaps using a counter as above? (I'd need to ask the Firecracker team).\r\n\r\nIf the code needs improvement to bring it up to the required quality I'm happy to do that (I'm very new to Rust and this is a learning exercise for me).", "updated_at": "2019-07-23T08:12:56Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/issues/comments/514103274", "author_association": "NONE", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/pull/16#issuecomment-514103274", "created_at": "2019-07-23T08:12:56Z", "id": 514103274, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDEwMzI3NA=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5NDQ=", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 2815944, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2815944?v=4", "login": "andreeaflorescu", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/andreeaflorescu", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/issues/16", "body": "@jiangliu do you have any major concerns with the code?", "updated_at": "2019-07-24T14:09:32Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/issues/comments/514648066", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/pull/16#issuecomment-514648066", "created_at": "2019-07-24T14:09:32Z", "id": 514648066, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDY0ODA2Ng=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjE5MzE1MTY=", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 1931516, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/1931516?v=4", "login": "jiangliu", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/jiangliu", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/jiangliu/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/issues/16", "body": "> @jiangliu do you have any major concerns with the code?\r\n\r\nIt's ok for using by test cases, but not sure whether the entropy source is safe for product code.", "updated_at": "2019-07-24T14:23:39Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/issues/comments/514653864", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/pull/16#issuecomment-514653864", "created_at": "2019-07-24T14:23:39Z", "id": 514653864, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDUxNDY1Mzg2NA=="}, {"user": {"following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/following{/other_user}", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu", "site_admin": false, "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/gists{/gist_id}", "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjI4MTU5NDQ=", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "gravatar_id": "", "id": 2815944, "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/events{/privacy}", "avatar_url": "https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2815944?v=4", "login": "andreeaflorescu", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/repos", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/subscriptions", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/followers", "html_url": "https://github.com/andreeaflorescu", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/received_events", "type": "User", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/andreeaflorescu/orgs"}, "issue_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vmm-sys-util/issues/16", "body": "@jiangliu we can add your concern as a comment for the functions that have this problem.
