The idea is that virtio-pmem memory map the backing file into the VMM address space, to make it available to the VM. So this is a clear use case where we want the portion of memory exposed from virtio-pmem to be part of the GuestMemory as a separate region. But this region cannot be considered the same as the region representing the RAM, otherwise the virtio device implementations will be broken, thinking that it is part of the VM RAM.\r\nThat's why having types associated with regions could be a simple way for any code in the VMM to check if the region should be considered or ignored, depending on what you're trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nI think this should be added once #29 will be merged.\r\n\r\n@bonzini @jiangliu @alexandruag WDYT?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/vm-memory/issues/34", "id": 458799308, "events_url":

With patches to address the review comments, the commit history became a little messy.
