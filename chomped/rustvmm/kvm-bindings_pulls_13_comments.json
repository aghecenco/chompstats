More details on this issue: rust-lang/rust-bindgen#1431.\r\n\r\nYes, having read that thread I agree the using the result of that `clone()` by itself is UB. However, the way we use it in FamStructWrapper is actually safe since we don't care about or touch that member, but just copy the memory values of the normal members.\r\n\r\nEven so, I agree we should **not** expose an implementation of the `Clone` trait for the unsafe fam struct. External users of this crate might decide to use that directly instead of through the safe FamStructWrapper which can lead to UB.\r\n\r\nI am closing this PR and attempting a fix directly in the `Clone` implementation of `FamStructWrapper`.", "updated_at": "2019-11-20T15:20:37Z", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rust-vmm/kvm-bindings/issues/comments/556050784", "author_association": "MEMBER", "html_url": "https://github.com/rust-vmm/kvm-bindings/pull/13#issuecomment-556050784", "created_at": "2019-11-20T15:20:37Z", "id": 556050784, "node_id": "MDEyOklzc3VlQ29tbWVudDU1NjA1MDc4NA=="}]
